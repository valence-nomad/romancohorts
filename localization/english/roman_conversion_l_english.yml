roman_conversion.0002.desc:0 "As I take stock of the battle raging below me, I notice a potential breach in my lines and turn to order a messenger to deploy part of my reserves. Suddenly, I feel a cool breeze running against my neck, somehow invigorating and sharpening my focus to a diamond point. I hear a voice from somewhere, telling me to charge the breach."

But [enemy_knight.GetTitledFirstName] stands firm against me and we exchange a flurry of strikes that end as [enemy_knight.GetSheHe] finds a hole in my guard and [enemy_knight.GetHerHis] weapon drives into my side. I drop my weapon, my body going numb, as one of my bodyguards spurs forward and drives [enemy_knight.GetHerHim] back before [enemy_knight.GetSheHe] can finish me off."
roman_conversion.0005.a:0 ""I was a fool to believe!""
