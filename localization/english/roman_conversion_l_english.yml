roman_conversion.0001.t:0 "Salvaged Texts"
roman_conversion.0001.desc:0 "My antiquarian has come to me with news. Apparently, there is a small, salvageable collection of old books in one of my libraries. They appear to be well-preserved, centuries-old writings by prominent Roman figures. It is said that the Romans were masters of many subjects, and their writings could be useful for a ruler to study."
roman_conversion.0001.a:0 "Perhaps the old Romans can shed light on how to win friends and influence people."
roman_conversion.0001.b:0 "I have heard the Romans were exceptional administrators."
roman_conversion.0001.c:0 "Weren't the Romans masters of warfare?"
roman_conversion.0001.d:0 "I hope to read of Roman history and philosophy."
roman_conversion.0001.e:0 "If the Romans were so superior, wherefore did their empire fall? Sell the trash."

convert_to_roman_culture_decision:0 "Adopt Roman Traditions"
convert_to_roman_culture_decision_desc:0 "I have studied the works, culture, and history of the ancient Romans. Their way of life and culture is most fascinating. Perhaps we should consider adopting some of the old Roman ways into our own society, and thereby gain some strength from the masters of the world."
convert_to_roman_culture_decision_tooltip:0 "I will become Roman"
convert_to_roman_culture_decision_confirm:0 "Ab antiquo, ad praesens!"

roman_conversion.0002.t:0 "A Vision of Glory"
roman_conversion.0002.desc:0 "As I take stock of the battle raging below me, I notice a potential breach in my lines and turn to order a messenger to deploy part of my reserves. Suddenly, I feel a cool breeze running against my neck, somehow invigorating and sharpening my focus to a diamond point. I hear a voice from somewhere, telling me to charge the breach."
roman_conversion.0002.a:0 ""Bodyguard! With me now, charge!""
roman_conversion.0002.b:0 "Ignore the voice and signal [friendly_knight.GetTitledFirstName] to advance."
roman_conversion.0002.c:0 "I dare not risk a charge."
roman_conversion.0002.a.tt:0 "Obey the voice and charge. This may be dangerous."
roman_conversion.0002.b.tt:0 "Give your original orders."
roman_conversion.0002.a.tt:0 "A charge would be very dangerous..."

roman_conversion.0003.desc.venus:0 "As my bodyguards and I thunder towards the enemy troops, I see the sunlight glinting off of a spearpoint next to me. I turn to look, and catch a glimpse of a nude woman so radiant the sight of her burns my eyes. She points a keen-edged spear towards the enemy and I turn back to see [enemy_knight.GetTitledFirstName] and [enemy_knight.GetHerHis] troops falling back in terror."
roman_conversion.0003.desc.mars:0 "As my bodyguards and I thunder towards the enemy troops, I see the sunlight glinting off of a spearpoint next to me. I turn to look, and catch a glimpse of an armored man so radiant the sight of him burns my eyes. He points a keen-edged spear towards the enemy and I turn back to see [enemy_knight.GetTitledFirstName] and [enemy_knight.GetHerHis] troops falling back in terror."
roman_conversion.0003.a:0 "Alala! Charge!"
roman_conversion.0003.b:0 ""Who was that? Did anyone see?""
roman_conversion.0003.c:0 "The gods are with us!"
roman_conversion.0003.a.tt:0 "You don't know where this strength came from, but you'll use any advantage you can."
roman_conversion.0003.b.tt:0 "What was that?"
roman_conversion.0003.c.tt:0 "With the favor of the gods, who can stop you?"
roman_conversion.0003.success:0 "Your charge drives the enemy back."
roman_conversion.0003.failure:0 "Your charge falters against the enemy."
roman_conversion.0003.critfail:0 "Your charge goes horribly wrong."

roman_conversion.0004.desc:0 "My bodyguards and I crash into the breach and rampage through the enemy lines like steel-clad tigers among sheep! With my first blow, I effortlessly strike [enemy_knight.GetTitledFirstName] from [enemy_knight.GetHerHis] saddle in a spray of blood. Thunder rings in my ears as I push forward, killing another enemy warrior with every step, until they flee broken from the field."
roman_conversion.0004.a:0 "I must know where this strength came from."
roman_conversion.0004.b:0 "I am truly a great warrior."
roman_conversion.0004.c:0 "The gods themselves fought beside us!"
roman_conversion.0004.a.tt:0 "Try to identify who the mysterious person was..."
roman_conversion.0004.b.tt:0 "Bask in the glory of the moment."
roman_conversion.0004.c.tt:0 "Praise the gods for their inspiration."

roman_conversion.0005.desc:0 "My bodyguards and I crash into the breach! But [enemy_knight.GetTitledFirstName] stands firm against me and we exchange a flurry of strikes that end as [enemy_knight.GetSheHe] finds a hole in my guard and [enemy_knight.GetHerHis] weapon drives into my side. I drop my weapon, my body going numb, as one of my bodyguards spurs forward and drives [enemy_knight.GetHerHim] back before [enemy_knight.GetSheHe] can finish me off."
roman_conversion.0005.a:0 ""I was a fool to believe!""
roman_conversion.0005.b:0 "How have I offended the gods?!"
roman_conversion.0005.a.tt:0 "You have been wounded in battle!"
roman_conversion.0005.b.tt:0 "Pray to Juno for her forgiveness!"

roman_conversion.0006.desc:0 "My bodyguards and I crash into the breach! But [enemy_knight.GetTitledFirstName] stands firm against me and we exchange a flurry of strikes that end as [enemy_knight.GetSheHe] finds a hole in my guard and [enemy_knight.GetHerHis] weapon drives into my chest. Icy pain explodes through my body and I am left staring at the great wound in my chest before I slowly topple from my horse."
roman_conversion.0006.a:0 "The figure lied to me..."
roman_conversion.0006.b:0 "The gods betrayed me..."
roman_conversion.0006.a.tt:0 "You have been killed in action."

convert_to_hellenism_decision_desc:0 "Rome was long ago led astray by false gods and false religions, leading to its downfall and utter ruin.
